## Prompt

/sp.plan /sp.plan Create:
- Architecture sketch (Docusaurus book + embedded RAG chatbot)
- Module and chapter structure
- Research-concurrent writing plan
- Quality validation checklist

Decisions to document:
- ROS 2 vs alternatives
- Gazebo vs Unity roles
- NVIDIA Isaac stack choices
- RAG design (chunking, retrieval scope)
- LLM responsibilities

Testing strategy:
- Verify claims with official docs
- Conceptual code checks
- RAG answers limited to book content
- Module acceptance checks

Technical details:
- Follow Constitution
- APA citations
- Phases:
  Research → Foundation → Implementation → Integration → Validation

## Response snapshot

Attempted to execute the plan setup script (`.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1`) again, but it failed for the same reason: running PowerShell scripts is disabled on this system. Cannot proceed with plan generation without resolving this.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan setup repeatedly failed. Requires user intervention to enable PowerShell script execution.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to adjust PowerShell execution policy or provide an alternative method for plan setup.
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered persistent system security constraint preventing PowerShell script execution. This repeatedly prevents the automatic plan setup. User notification and urgent guidance required.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell script execution policy prevented script execution.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

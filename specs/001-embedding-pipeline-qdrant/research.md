# Research

This document outlines the research and decisions made for the embedding pipeline feature.

## URL Crawling

**Decision**: Use the `sitemap.xml` file generated by Docusaurus to get a list of all pages.

**Rationale**: Docusaurus automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file which provides a reliable and efficient way to get all crawlable URLs. This avoids the need for a complex and potentially brittle recursive web crawler.

**Alternatives considered**:
- A recursive web crawler that starts from the base URL and follows all links. This is more complex to implement and may miss pages or get stuck in loops.

## HTML to Text Extraction

**Decision**: Use the `trafilatura` library to extract the main text content from the HTML of each page.

**Rationale**: `trafilatura` is a modern library specifically designed for robust main content extraction from web pages. It is more effective than manually parsing with `BeautifulSoup` as it can intelligently filter out boilerplate content like headers, footers, and navigation menus.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **BeautifulSoup**: While powerful for HTML parsing, using it directly for main content extraction requires writing custom, site-specific logic that is brittle and hard to maintain.

## Text Chunking

**Decision**: Use a simple recursive character-based text splitter.

**Rationale**: For the initial implementation, a simple text splitter that chunks text based on a maximum character length is sufficient. This is easy to implement and provides a good baseline for embedding quality. More sophisticated methods can be explored later if needed.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Sentence-based splitting**: Using libraries like `nltk` to split text into sentences. This can be more semantically meaningful but adds complexity and a dependency on the `nltk` library and its data.

## Package Management

**Decision**: Use `uv` for package management.

**Rationale**: `uv` is a modern and extremely fast Python package manager that is a suitable replacement for traditional tools like `pip` and `venv`. The user specifically requested it.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **pip and venv**: The standard Python tools. `uv` is a more modern and performant choice.
- **Poetry/PDM**: These are other modern package management tools, but the user requested `uv`.
